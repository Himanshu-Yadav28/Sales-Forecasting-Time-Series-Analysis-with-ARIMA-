# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis 

This project focuses on sales forecasting using time series analysis techniques. The primary model used is ARIMA, a powerful statistical method for analyzing and predicting future trends based on historical data. The project aims to provide accurate forecasts that can help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Key Objectives

- Time Series Analysis: Analyzes trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical sales data.

- ARIMA Model Implementation: Uses ARIMA to generate sales forecasts.

- Performance Evaluation: Measures forecast accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

- Visualization: Generates plots to visualize historical trends and future predictions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

- Plotly

##  Performance Evaluation

To assess the accuracy of the model, the project calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which provides insight into how well the forecasted values match actual sales data.
